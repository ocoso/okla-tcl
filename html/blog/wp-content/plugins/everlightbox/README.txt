EverlightBox is a very **fast** and **safe** lightbox for WordPress. It can be used with WordPress galleries like:

* WordPress native galleries
* [Final Tiles Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/final-tiles-grid-gallery-lite/)
* [Modula Grid Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/modula-best-grid-gallery/)
 
and any linked image. You can even activate it using custom CSS selectors, so it's virtually compatible with every gallery plugin.

EverlightBox is also a perfect solution for **mobile** devices, it supports swipe gestures so users are able to browse your images in a more natural way.
